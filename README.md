📧 Real-Time Spam Detection Engine
This project delivers a fast, interactive application for classifying text messages as either legitimate ("Ham") or malicious ("Spam"). Built with Python and the Streamlit framework, the application uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to provide high-accuracy classification and a confidence score for real-time risk assessment.

✨ Features
Instant Classification: Enter any text (email snippet, SMS, etc.) and get an immediate classification result.

High Confidence Scoring: Displays a confidence score to assess the certainty of the model's prediction.

Intuitive UI: A clean, responsive user interface built using Streamlit and custom CSS for a professional look.

Machine Learning Backbone: Uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier trained on a corpus of real-world spam and non-spam messages.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend/Deployment: Streamlit

Backend/ML: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn (for ML model and vectorization), pandas (for data handling).

🚀 Getting Started
To run this application locally or deploy it, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
You must have Python installed.

1. Project Structure
Ensure your repository contains the following files in the root directory:

/
├── app.py            # The main Streamlit application (previously app_hackathon.py)
├── spam_model.pkl    # Pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model
├── vectorizer.pkl    # Pre-fitted CountVectorizer object
└── requirements.txt  # Python dependency list


2. Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Application
Execute the Streamlit app from your terminal:

streamlit run app.py


The application will open automatically in your browser.

🔮 Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)
API Endpoint Integration: Complete the half-built API endpoint to allow external services (like n8n, Zapier) to automate spam filtering for email inboxes.

Model Improvement: Explore other algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines or deep learning models) for potential accuracy gains.

User Feedback Loop: Implement a feature for users to report misclassifications to continuously improve the model.
